This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing and categorizing user activity across multiple EVM-compatible blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum). The goal is to identify whether users who are active on one network are also active on others, and to classify them into categories such as single-network participants, multi-chain users, dormant addresses, and liquidity migrators. The project leverages on-chain data from blockchain explorers (Etherscan, BscScan, Polygonscan, etc.) to map wallet activity and understand behavioral trends.
